ooo-app
=======

ooo-app is a simple framework for social webapps written in Java. In
conjunction with a bunch of other OOO libraries, it provides user management
and a few other basic services.

It's probably not wildly useful for anyone outside OOO, but it's easier to make
it public so that it can be built on our public continuous build server and
included Heroku deploments.

Distribution
------------

ooo-app is released under the New BSD License. The most recent version of the
library is available at http://github.com/threerings/ooo-app
